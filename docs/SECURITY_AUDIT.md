# DapsiGames Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security measures implemented in DapsiGames and provides recommendations for ongoing security maintenance.

**Audit Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 8 Implementation Complete  
**Risk Level:** Low to Medium

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization ✅

**Implemented:**
- Password hashing using bcrypt with configurable salt rounds
- Email-based authentication via Supabase
- Session management with automatic token refresh
- Password complexity requirements (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Email verification for new accounts
- Password reset functionality

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] Implement two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Add account lockout after failed login attempts
- [ ] Implement session timeout warnings
- [ ] Add device tracking for unusual login locations

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization ✅

**Implemented:**
- Zod schema validation for all data inputs
- Express-validator for additional validation
- URL validation for avatar uploads
- SQL injection protection via Drizzle ORM
- Request body size limits

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] Add file upload validation if implementing file uploads
- [ ] Implement content sanitization for user-generated content
- [ ] Add image upload scanning for malicious content

### 3. Rate Limiting ✅

**Implemented:**
- General API rate limit: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- Authentication endpoints: 10 requests per 15 minutes
- Per-IP tracking
- Standard headers for rate limit info

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] Implement per-user rate limiting (in addition to per-IP)
- [ ] Add exponential backoff for repeated violations
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for rate limit monitoring

### 4. Security Headers ✅

**Implemented via Helmet.js:**
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-XSS-Protection
- Cross-Origin policies

**Current CSP Configuration:**
```javascript
{
  defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
  scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "'unsafe-eval'"],
  styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
  imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:", "blob:"],
  connectSrc: ["'self'", "ws:", "wss:", "https:"],
  fontSrc: ["'self'", "data:"],
  objectSrc: ["'none'"],
  mediaSrc: ["'self'"],
  frameSrc: ["'none'"],
}
```

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] Tighten CSP once in production (remove unsafe-inline/unsafe-eval)
- [ ] Add report-uri for CSP violations
- [ ] Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external scripts

### 5. Data Protection ✅

**Implemented:**
- Passwords never returned in API responses
- HTTPS enforcement (automatic on Replit)
- Secure cookie configuration
- Environment variable protection for secrets

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] Implement data encryption at rest for sensitive user data
- [ ] Add audit logging for data access
- [ ] Implement GDPR compliance features (data export, deletion)
- [ ] Add data retention policies

### 6. Error Handling ✅

**Implemented:**
- Error boundary components in React
- Consistent error response format
- No stack traces in production responses
- Comprehensive error logging

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] Implement error monitoring service (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Add error rate alerting
- [ ] Create error response localization

### 7. WebSocket Security ✅

**Implemented:**
- WebSocket over WSS in production
- Connection validation
- Event-based message handling

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] Add WebSocket authentication
- [ ] Implement message rate limiting
- [ ] Add connection timeout handling
- [ ] Validate all incoming WebSocket messages

## Vulnerability Assessment

### High Priority ⚠️

**None identified** - All critical vulnerabilities have been addressed in Phase 8.

### Medium Priority

1. **Missing Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Risk: Account takeover if password is compromised
   - Mitigation: Implement 2FA in next phase
   - Temporary: Strong password requirements, email verification

2. **Insufficient WebSocket Authentication**
   - Risk: Unauthorized access to real-time features
   - Mitigation: Add token-based WebSocket authentication
   - Temporary: Connection validation, event filtering

3. **No Account Lockout**
   - Risk: Brute force attacks on login
   - Mitigation: Implement account lockout after 5 failed attempts
   - Temporary: Rate limiting on auth endpoints

### Low Priority

1. **CSP Allows unsafe-inline**
   - Risk: XSS attacks via inline scripts
   - Mitigation: Remove unsafe-inline, use nonces
   - Temporary: Input sanitization, CSP headers

2. **No Data Encryption at Rest**
   - Risk: Database breach exposes data
   - Mitigation: Implement field-level encryption
   - Temporary: Database access controls, regular backups
