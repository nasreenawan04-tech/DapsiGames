   Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 400
   ```
   **Status**: Non-blocking. ViteClient connection issue in development. Not affecting production WebSocket at `/ws`.

2. **Auth Session Missing (Expected)**:
   ```
   Error fetching current user: Error: Auth session missing!
   ```
   **Status**: Expected behavior for non-logged-in users. Error handling working correctly.

3. **Bundle Size Warning**:
   - Main chunk: 696 KB (gzipped: 204 KB)
   **Status**: Acceptable for initial release. Optimization opportunity for future phases.
