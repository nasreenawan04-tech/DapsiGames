# Vercel Deployment Error Fix

## Problem Summary
Your Vercel deployment was failing with a `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` error related to missing Rollup modules (`@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu`). This happens when optional dependencies aren't properly handled during the build process.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling (`server/index.ts`)
Added comprehensive error handling with detailed logging throughout the serverless function:
- **Granular try/catch blocks** at every initialization step
- **Detailed console logging** that shows up in Vercel's `/_logs` endpoint
- **Request timing** to identify slow operations
- **Stack traces** for all errors
- **Initialization error caching** to consistently surface root causes

Example logs you'll now see:
```
[setupApp] Starting application setup...
[setupApp] Environment: production
[setupApp] Running on Vercel: YES
[Vercel Handler] Request: GET /api/health
[Vercel Handler] App initialized, processing request...
```

### 2. Fixed Build Configuration (`vercel.json`)
Updated the installation command to handle optional dependencies:
```json
"installCommand": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps --omit=optional"
```

This prevents Rollup's platform-specific optional dependencies from blocking the build.

Also increased:
- **Memory limit**: 1024 MB (from default 512 MB)
- **Max duration**: 60 seconds for longer operations

### 3. Improved Deployment Exclusions (`.vercelignore`)
Enhanced the ignore file to exclude unnecessary files, reducing bundle size and cold-start times:
- Test files (`*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`)
- Development configs (`.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc`)
- Build artifacts and cache directories
- Replit-specific files

### 4. Added Debug Endpoints

#### Health Check: `/api/health`
Returns application status with database connectivity:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T03:30:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 120,
  "environment": "production",
  "platform": "vercel",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

#### Debug Info: `/api/debug`
Returns environment and system information for troubleshooting:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T03:30:00.000Z",
  "environment": "production",
  "platform": "vercel",
  "nodeVersion": "v20.x.x",
  "uptime": 120,
  "memory": { ... },
  "env": {
    "hasDatabase": true,
    "hasSessionSecret": true,
    "isVercel": true,
    "region": "iad1"
  }
}
```

## How to View Vercel Logs

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click on the latest deployment
4. Click "**Functions**" tab
5. Click on your function (usually `api/index`)
6. View the **Logs** section

### Method 2: Direct URL (During Request)
Visit your deployed site at:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/_logs
```

This shows real-time logs from function invocations. The logs will appear as requests are made.

### Method 3: Use Debug Endpoints
After deploying, visit these URLs to verify your app is working:

**Health Check:**
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health
```

**Debug Info:**
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/debug
```

## Troubleshooting Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Verify Build Succeeds
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your deployment
3. Check that the build completed successfully
4. Look for this message in build logs:
   ```
   ✓ Build completed successfully
   ```

### Step 2: Check Function Logs
1. Make a request to your app (any page)
2. Go to Functions tab → api/index → Logs
3. Look for the initialization logs:
   ```
   [setupApp] Starting application setup...
   [setupApp] Routes registered successfully
   [setupApp] Application setup completed successfully
   ```

### Step 3: Test Health Endpoint
Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

**If you see an error**, the response will include:
```json
{
  "status": "unhealthy",
  "database": "disconnected",
  "databaseError": "connection timeout"
}
```

### Step 4: Review Debug Info
Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/debug`

This shows:
- Environment variables status (without showing actual values)
- Memory usage
- Platform information
- Node version

### Step 5: Check Function Invocation
1. Navigate to any page on your app
2. Check Vercel logs for:
   ```
   [Vercel Handler] Request: GET /
   [Vercel Handler] App initialized, processing request...
   [Vercel Handler] Request completed in 250ms
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Still Getting FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED

**Solution 1: Clear Vercel Cache**
```bash
vercel --prod --force
```

**Solution 2: Check Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set in Vercel:
- `DATABASE_URL` (if using database)
- `SESSION_SECRET` (required for production)
- Any Firebase credentials (if using Firebase auth)

**Solution 3: Review Logs**
Check Vercel logs for the actual error message:
1. Go to Functions → api/index → Logs
2. Look for `[Vercel Handler] ERROR` messages
3. The error type and stack trace will be shown

### Issue: Database Connection Failed

Check `/api/health` endpoint. If database is "disconnected":
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set in Vercel environment variables
2. Ensure your database allows connections from Vercel's IP ranges
3. Check if database is running (for Neon, check their dashboard)

### Issue: Timeout Errors

If requests timeout after 60 seconds:
1. Check for infinite loops in initialization
2. Review database queries for missing indexes
3. Consider increasing `maxDuration` in `vercel.json`

### Issue: Memory Errors

If function crashes with out-of-memory:
1. Current limit is 1024 MB
2. Can increase in `vercel.json` (requires Pro plan for >1024 MB)
3. Review memory usage in `/api/debug` endpoint

## Next Steps

1. **Redeploy to Vercel** with these fixes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED error with comprehensive logging"
   git push
   ```

2. **Monitor the deployment**:
   - Watch the build logs for successful completion
   - Check function logs during first request

3. **Verify endpoints**:
   - Visit `/api/health` to confirm app is healthy
   - Visit `/api/debug` to verify configuration
   - Test your main application features

4. **Review logs regularly**:
   - Check Vercel dashboard → Functions → Logs
   - Look for any error patterns
   - Monitor response times

## What the Logs Will Show You

With these fixes, Vercel logs will now display:

✅ **Initialization status** at each step
✅ **Database connection** attempts and results  
✅ **Route registration** success/failure
✅ **Request processing** times
✅ **Error stack traces** for debugging
✅ **Memory usage** and environment info

This makes it much easier to identify exactly where and why any failures occur.

## Summary

All the troubleshooting steps you were asked to follow are now addressed:

1. ✅ **Application logs** - Added comprehensive logging with detailed error messages
2. ✅ **Function code review** - Added try/catch blocks throughout
3. ✅ **Unhandled exceptions** - All exceptions are now caught and logged
4. ✅ **Function configuration** - Updated `vercel.json` with proper settings

The errors will now be visible in Vercel's logs at the `/_logs` path and in the Functions tab of your Vercel dashboard.
