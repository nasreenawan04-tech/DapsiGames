# Firebase Authentication Setup

## Overview

Your DapsiGames application now uses Firebase Authentication for user login and signup. This provides secure, scalable authentication with industry-standard security practices.

## What Was Implemented

### Frontend Integration
- **Firebase SDK**: Initialized with your project credentials
- **Authentication Service**: Handles signup, login, and logout operations
- **Auto-sync**: Firebase users are automatically synced with your backend database

### Backend Integration
- **Firebase Admin SDK**: Verifies authentication tokens securely
- **Session Management**: Creates secure sessions after Firebase authentication
- **User Database Sync**: Firebase users are stored in your PostgreSQL database
- **Auto-initialization**: New users automatically get stats, streaks, coins, and levels

## How It Works

1. **User Signs Up**:
   - Frontend creates account in Firebase
   - Firebase returns an authentication token
   - Backend verifies the token using Firebase Admin SDK
   - User is created in your database with initial stats
   - Secure session is created

2. **User Logs In**:
   - Frontend authenticates with Firebase
   - Firebase returns an authentication token
   - Backend verifies the token
   - Secure session is created
   - User data is returned to frontend

## Security Features Implemented

✅ **Token Verification**: All Firebase tokens are verified server-side using Firebase Admin SDK  
✅ **Session Regeneration**: Sessions are regenerated on login/signup to prevent session fixation  
✅ **Email Verification**: Email addresses are extracted from verified tokens only (not from request body)  
✅ **Secure Sessions**: HttpOnly cookies with proper security settings  

## Important: Firebase Admin Credentials

The Firebase Admin SDK requires authentication to verify tokens. You'll need to set up one of these options:

### Option 1: Service Account (Recommended for Production)
1. Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
2. Click "Generate New Private Key"
3. Download the JSON file
4. Add it as a secret in Replit named `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`

### Option 2: Application Default Credentials
Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to your service account JSON file.

### Current Setup
The application is currently configured to use your project ID from the environment variables. For full functionality in production, you'll need to add proper service account credentials.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are already configured:
- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files
- `client/src/lib/firebase.ts` - Firebase client initialization
- `client/src/services/firebaseAuthService.ts` - Firebase authentication functions
- `server/lib/firebaseAdmin.ts` - Firebase Admin SDK initialization

### Modified Files
- `client/src/services/authService.ts` - Updated to use Firebase
- `server/routes.ts` - Added Firebase authentication endpoints

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/auth/firebase-register** - Register new user via Firebase
- **POST /api/auth/firebase-login** - Login existing user via Firebase
- **POST /api/auth/logout** - Logout (works for both Firebase and traditional auth)
- **GET /api/auth/me** - Get current user session

## Testing

The application is currently running and the signup page is accessible. To test:
1. Visit the signup page
2. Create an account with email and password
3. Firebase will authenticate the user
4. Backend will create the user record and session
5. User will be redirected to the dashboard

## Next Steps

1. **Add Firebase Service Account** (for production):
   - Generate a service account key from Firebase Console
   - Add it to your environment configuration

2. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - Create a test account
   - Verify login works
   - Check that user data is properly synced

3. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add password reset functionality
   - Add email verification
   - Add social login providers (Google, Facebook, etc.)

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
- Check browser console for frontend errors
- Check server logs for backend errors
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure Firebase project is properly configured
